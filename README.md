# ListManipulation
UTM Hack Lab Code Golf Challenge 1
Did you know that a list of n numbers can be permuted enough times to return to the original list? This permutation can be done by reversing the list and swapping each pair of numbers. Repeating these steps will eventually return the original that we started with. 

Write the shortest Python implementation (in bytes) of a function that takes integer n as an input and outputs the permutations of the lists as described above. 

NOTE: You are not allowed to use the following functions in your implementation: Lambda, Zip, Map.
